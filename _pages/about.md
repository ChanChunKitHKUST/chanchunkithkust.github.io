I am ChunKit Chan, a Ph.D. student from the [Computer Science and Engineering(CSE)](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/) department at [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/zh-hant), funded by the [HKPFS](https://fytgs.hkust.edu.hk/scholarships/hong-kong-phd-fellowship-scheme) award and supervised by [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~yqsong/). Previously, I received an MPhil degree in CSE from HKUST in 2021-2023, also supervised by [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~yqsong/) and a Master's degree in Big Data and Technology from HKUST in 2021. From 2022 to 2024, I worked as a research intern at the NVIDIA AI Technology Center. Now, I work as an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon in Palo Alto.


# Research Interests 

* Theory of Mind and Mental World Modeling in Large Language Models
Investigating how LLMs can develop and demonstrate understanding of others' mental states (Belief, Desire, and Intention), while constructing rich internal representations of subjective mental worlds. Creating novel evaluation frameworks to measure both ToM capabilities and mental world modeling in language models.
* Emergent Reasoning Capabilities in LLMs Through Reinforcement Learning
Exploring how reinforcement learning techniques can enhance reasoning ability (e.g., ToM reasoning). Developing more effective reward mechanisms for training RL-based models.
* Multi-Agent Systems with Theory of Mind and Shared Mental Worlds
Designing collaborative AI systems where multiple agents can effectively model each other's mental state while developing shared mental representations to solve complex problems. Exploring emergent social behaviors in multi-agent systems with ToM capabilities.
* LLM-Based Autonomous Agents and ToM for Real-World Applications
Developing language model-powered agents that can autonomously plan, execute, and reflect on real-world complex tasks by modeling human intentions and mental states. Creating robust frameworks for assessing how Theory of Mind capabilities enhance agent/machine performance across diverse real-world scenarios.
